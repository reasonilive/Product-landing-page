<p>
  In the land of Perendal, where the moon never sets and the rivers murmur forgotten names, the world is unraveling. Ancient cities crumble beneath an unchanging sky, and silence seeps into the corners of a once-thriving kingdom. Through the desolate streets walks a lone wanderer, burdened by memories that do not belong to them. Faces of strangers haunt their mind—fragments of a past they cannot recall, yet cannot ignore. Somewhere within these fading echoes lies the key to a truth long buried, a truth that binds them to the fate of this dying realm.</p>

<p>As the land frays at the edges of existence, time itself seems to be slipping away. The wanderer’s journey is not merely one of self-discovery but of urgency, for Perendal is dissolving into silence, its stories on the verge of vanishing forever. The rivers whisper their warnings, the ruins hold their secrets, and with each passing moment, the final thread of this world threatens to snap. If they cannot uncover the truth in time, Perendal will fade—not only from history, but from memory itself.
